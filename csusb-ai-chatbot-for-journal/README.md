## Running the Application

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### Step 1: Remove the existing code directory completely

Because the local repository can't been updated correctly, need to remove the directory first.

```bash
rm -rf team1f25
```

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DrAlzahrani2025Projects/team1f25.git
```

### Step 3: Navigate to the Repository

Change to the cloned repository directory:

```bash
cd team1f25
```

### Step 4: Pull the Latest Version

Update the repository to the latest version:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

### Step 5: Make Scripts Executable

Make the setup and cleanup scripts executable. This step only needs to be done once.

*Note: If you are on Windows, you must run this command in a `bash` terminal, such as the one provided by Git Bash or WSL.*

```bash
chmod +x scripts/startup.sh scripts/cleanup.sh
```

### Step 6: Run the Startup Script

Execute the startup script to begin the setup process.

```bash
./scripts/startup.sh
```

### Step 7: Enter Your API Key

When prompted by the script, paste your Groq API key from Team1 Canvas discussion board and press Enter.

### Step 8: Access the AI Agent

Once the container starts, open your browser and navigate to:

[http://localhost:5001/team1f25](http://localhost:5001/team1f25/)

### Step 9: Clean Up

When you are finished, run the cleanup script to stop and remove the Docker container and image.

```bash
./scripts/cleanup.sh
```
